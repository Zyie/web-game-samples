# Plain HTML/JS/CSS sample

This sample uses plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to demonstrate a very minimal integration with most functionality. Full games will most often use an engine or a framework, but the integration concepts remain applicable.

## Run

This sample requires no compilation or dependencies.

To run, use any web server. For example, you can use a python3 web server like this to serve the sample on port `9000`:

```shell
# Ensure you are in this directory.
python3 -m http.server 9000
```
